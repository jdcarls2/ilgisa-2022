# ILGISA 2022

Well, folks, I've really done it this time. I submitted 4 presentations to ILGISA this year, and told them I'd be willing to do all of them. They took me up on it.

In the interest of making as much of my work as open as possible for interested folks, I'm bundling it all into a single repo here. At the very least, it'll give you a single place to look for slides.

# Farm Cards

Of the 4 topics, **Farm Cards** is the only one that actually exists as its [own repo already](https://github.com/kcgis/farm-cards). For that reason, it's included in this repo as a *subtree*. That means it's a snapshot, and may fall out of date as work is done on the source repo, so just be aware of that.
