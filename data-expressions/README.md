Arcade isn't JavaScript, really. But as far as the way it works, it may as well be. Writing our expressions in javascript will help with the proper syntax highlighting.

Of course, for demonstration purposes, we'll just be using a dashboard anyway. But it helps to use an IDE to craft a Data Expression.

While the presentation itself will be done via slides in a Jupyter Notebook, each expression will also be included in this directory as a separate file.
